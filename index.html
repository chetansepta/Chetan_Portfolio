            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Chetan Septa, I a student with a strong interest in coding and technology. After completing my 12th grade at "Swami Vivekanand Higher Secondary School in Punjapura, Dewas", I continued my education at "Medi-caps University" in Indore, Where I develop my skills in programming languages. I have completed a certification course in C and C++ from Universal Informatics and have also gained knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C/C++. My passion for web development led me to self-directed learning in HTML, CSS and JS through YouTube, which allowed me to develop a solid foundation in web development. I have applied these skills in three projects, where I created a login page, a clone of Myntra, and a responsive and user-friendly landing page. To implement and improve my skills, I am looking for an internship where I can contribute my knowledge to live projects and prepare myself for the industry.
            <br>
            I have a strong foundation in C and C++ programming. To align with current industry trends, I have started working on Java and continuously practice it to develop my problem-solving and programming skills.
            <br>
            Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning JavaScript while working on my university mini project, "Medical Health Analyzer." This experience is helping me gain a deeper understanding of both front-end and back-end development concepts. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends.
            <br> 
            Apart from programming, I am passionate about photography, videography, and editing, which help me stay creative and refreshed. This passion led me to serve as the "Head of Photography" for the "CSI (Computer Society of India)" at Medi-Caps University.
